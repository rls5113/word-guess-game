#word-guess-game
This is the classic game we learned in grade school.

When you start a game, a word will be chosen for you to guess. The word will be any word; noun, pronoun, adjective, ... anything. Blanks and hyphens will be given. A general hint as to what type of word you are guessing will be provide by the game.

You may choose only keys a thru z and capitals. The game will ignore any invalid keys. You will have 6 attempts to guess the word. If you succeed, you will be rewarded, but if you fail, expect ridicule. Best of luck. Click "Start" to begin.
